# Build A Portfolio Website

With the help of [https://html5up.net/](https://html5up.net/), I'm fine tuning my personal portfolio website.

## TODOS

- [x] Study the code base and identify both responsive units and where media queries were used.  Take notes on anything that confuses you or interesting things you find.  Share this information in your standup meeting with your group
- [ ] Customize the template to you 
	- [x] Update the title tag match your name
	- [ ] Update the place holder content throughout the template to your information
		* Some templates are much larger than others, you don't need to fill in every little div with information, just try to get the site representing you and your work 
		* You can use sites like [https://www.pexels.com/](https://www.pexels.com/) for free images to fill in place holders
		* Showcase projects you have worked on by providing some information and links to your git hub projects
	- [ ] Create finish the portfolio page
		- [ ] portfolio page initialize
		- [ ] content filling
		- [ ] fine tuning
- [ ] Implement proper attribution: Attribution is required under the [creative commons license](https://html5up.net/license) that came with the website files you downloaded.  Be sure to provide attribution somewhere in the site.  The templates should already come with attribution found in most footers but double check to be sure.
- [ ] Host your website for the world to see. Follow the instructions found here [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/).  Once you have hosted your web page, share it for your peers to see.  This is not a small feat!

### Future incorporation:

- [ ] Photo Gallery

## Stretch

- [ ] Study the JavaScript used in your template and see if you can tweak any of the behavior to see how it works
- [ ] Download another template and see if you can get the CSS preprocessor working on the project

## Project Set Up

### Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

_ Watch this walk through video:  https://youtu.be/P2Y9W29kcjs

- [x] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [x] Create a new branch on the clone: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
- [x] Implement the project on the `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [x] Push commits: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`.

### Follow these steps to download your template and start the project:

- [x] Navigate here: [https://html5up.net/](https://html5up.net/)
- [x] You make pick any template you like.  Here are some good choices for a portfolio:

	- [https://html5up.net/miniport](https://html5up.net/miniport)
	- [https://html5up.net/dimension](https://html5up.net/dimension)

- [x] Unzip the code and copy the site to your git repository that you just set up
  * Note that we won't be utilizing the pre processed CSS structure, you can just ignore any folder with LESS or SASS (SCSS) in it.
